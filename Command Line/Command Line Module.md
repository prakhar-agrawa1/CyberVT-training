# Command Line Module ðŸ’»

## Why Master the Command Line?

Welcome to your first step into cybersecurity work! The command line is your Swiss Army knife in cybersecurity. It's how professionals navigate systems, analyze logs, run security tools, and automate tasks. Whether you're investigating a breach, configuring firewalls, or analyzing malware, you'll spend most of your time in terminal windows.

### Real-World Applications:
- **Incident Response**: Navigate compromised systems and collect evidence
- **Penetration Testing**: Use command-line tools to test security
- **Security Operations**: Monitor systems and analyze logs
- **Digital Forensics**: Extract and examine data from systems
- **System Administration**: Secure and maintain networks

Think of this module as learning to speak the language that all cybersecurity tools understand. Master this, and you'll be ready for more advanced topics.

## Training Objectives

By the end of this modu, you'll be able to:
- Navigate file systems efficiently using command-line navigation
- Edit files and manage data using terminal text editors and commands
- Understand and modify user permissions and file access controls
- Troubleshoot common command-line issues independently

## Learning Progression

### Step 1 (Foundation): "Remember" and "Understand"
**Complete TryHackMe modules to learn fundamental concepts**
- [Linux Fundamentals Part 1](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart1) - Master basic navigation and file operations
- [Complete Questions 1-19 of Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/the-shell) - Demonstrate an understanding of basic command line navigation commands 
- [Windows Command Line](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowscommandline) - Learn Windows-specific commands
- [Windows Fundamentals Part 1](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsfundamentals1xbx) - Understand Windows system basics

**Deliverable**: Screenshots showing completion of each room

### Step 2 (Guided Application): "Apply" and "Analyze" 
**Complete OverTheWire Bandit Levels 1-15**

- [OverTheWire Bandit Levels 1-15](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)

Practice real command-line problem solving in a gamified environment that mirrors actual security scenarios.

**Deliverable**: Document solutions and explanations for each level

## Assessment & Support
We want to ensure you truly understand these concepts, not just complete the tasks. Your submissions should include:
- Brief explanations of your problem-solving approach
- Reflection on what you learned and found challenging
- Questions or areas where you'd like additional clarification

Please reach out to facilitators when you need help!

## NIST Compliance
This module aligns with NIST workforce standards:
