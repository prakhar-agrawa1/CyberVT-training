The Command Line Interface, or CLI, allows us to rapidly configure or troubleshoot settings and policies on our device, though it could take some time to get used to.

My main challenge during this module (Over the Wire) was figuring out which commands I should be using. However, each level included a "Commands you may need to solve this level" section which helped a lot in narrowing down and finding the right command for a given scenario. In addition, I often used the command manuals and searched online for the right options.

Ultimately, I learned to navigate the CLI efficiently and utilize the most common commands.
