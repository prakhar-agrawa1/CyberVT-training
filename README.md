# Welcome to CyberVT's Cyber Training Program! (Cyber101)

Welcome to CyberVT's cybersecurity training program designed specifically for students ready to dive into the world of cybersecurity.

## What is This Program?
The CyberVT Training Program is your gateway to developing real-world cybersecurity skills. Whether you're completely new to cybersecurity or looking to strengthen your foundation, this program meets you where you are and builds your skills through hands-on, practical training that mirrors what you'll encounter in the field.

## Why Does This Matter?
Cybersecurity isn't just about knowing theory, it's also important to know *how* to do things. When you graduate and land that dream job, employers expect you to have some background knowledge to hit the ground running. This program bridges the gap between classroom learning and the reality of cybersecurity by giving you practical experience with the tools, techniques, and thinking patterns that cybersecurity professionals use every day.

Plus, we want to send you to competitions where you can showcase your skills! But we also want to win those competitions, which means we need you to have a solid foundation before you represent CyberVT on the stage.

## How Will This Help You Become "Better at Cyber"?
Each module in this program is designed around real scenarios you'll face in your cybersecurity careers:

- **Cryptography** helps you understand how data protection actually works and how attackers break it
- **Reconnaissance** teaches you to think like both an attacker and defender
- **Forensics** develops your investigative mindset for incident response
- **Reverse Engineering** builds your ability to understand and analyze unknown threats
- **System Hardening** understand how to protect and defend systems
- **And much more!**

By completing these modules, you're building a toolkit of practical skills that will make you a valuable cybersecurity asset and professional.

## Real-World Application
Every technique you learn here has direct applications in cybersecurity careers:
- **Security Analyst**: You'll use forensics and reconnaissance skills to investigate incidents
- **Penetration Tester**: Command line, networking, and reconnaissance become your daily tools
- **Security Engineer**: Understanding cryptography and system hardening helps you build secure systems
- **Incident Response**: Forensics and reverse engineering skills help you understand and contain threats
